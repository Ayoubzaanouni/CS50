#### Description:

Introduction:

Flappy Dro3 is a game inspired by the popular mobile game Flappy Bird. In this game, the player controls a bird named Dro3 and the objective is to fly through as many pipes as possible without colliding with them. The game is built using Ursina game engine.

Design choices:

The game was developed using the Ursina game engine, which is a popular choice for 2D/3D game development in Python. Ursina provides a simple and intuitive interface for creating 2D games, with features such as easy entity creation, physics simulation, and sound effects.
The game features a 2D bird sprite. The pipes are also 2D sprites that are randomly generated and positioned on the screen. The player controls the bird's height by pressing the spacebar, and gravity pulls the bird down between jumps.


Game play:

The game is easy to play, but difficult to master. The player controls Dro3 by pressing the spacebar to make him fly. The objective is to fly through as many pipes as possible without colliding with them. Each time Dro3 successfully passes through a pipe, the player scores one point. The game ends if Dro3 collides with a pipe or if he flies out of bounds.

The game features three levels, with the difficulty increasing as the player progresses. Level 1 is the default level, while level 2 is unlocked when the player achieves a score of 20. Level 3 is unlocked when the player achieves a score of 40. Each level features different pipe layouts and speeds, making the game progressively harder.

In addition to the game mechanics, the game also features funny voice effects when the player loses the game. This was done by using the playsound library in Python to play pre-recorded voice clips.
